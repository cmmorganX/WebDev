<h3> Summit Farms : Caring for Your Alaskan Dog</h3>

<p>In a nutshell, an Alaskan Husky will need as much daily exercise as you can possibly give it. 90 minutes of proper physical activity a day should be the minimum, and your Husky can handle much more than that! You can start exercising your Husky at three months of age by taking it on short (10- to 15-minute) leashed walks, then you can increase the walks' length and frequency as the puppy grows.</p>


<h4>Ways to Exercise Your Dog</h4>

<ol class="olsummit">

	<li><b>Walking/Jogging/Bicycling:</b> Two 30-minute walks (or 20-minute jogs or bike rides) is the minimum requirement</li>
	<li><b>Fetch:</b> An Alaskan Husky will chase a ball or stick for hours</li>
	<li><b>Tug-of-War:</b> Great indoor, rainy-day activity; give the dog a treat when it finds you</li>
	<li><b>Sled Pulling:</b> These dogs can pull sleds for many miles without stopping</li>
	<li><b>Dog Park:</b> As pack animals, Huskies love the company of other dogs</li>
	<li><b>Canine Sports:</b> Alaskan Huskies excel at agility trials, flyball, and other competitions</li>
	<li><b>Hiking:</b> Excellent bonding activity; your Husky will even carry the backpack</li>

</ol>

<h4>Mitigating Chewing</h4>

<p>If your Alaskan Husky must spend long periods indoors, it's a good idea to give the dog access to one or more balls or chew-toys that will allow it to burn excess energy. We also recommended that you establish a consistent exercise schedule for the dog, such as walks, jogs, or bike rides after breakfast and dinner and a play period in the afternoon.</p>

<h4>Alaskan Hygiene and Cleaning</h4>

<p>In terms of shedding and drooling, dogs of this breed type need low to moderate care. Alaskan Husky shedding is light for most of the year, but heavier during the spring and fall shedding seasons. They also drool a little, particularly after exercising.</p>

<p>Alaskan Huskies have thick, double-layered coats that shed a little for most of the year, but in the spring and fall, the shedding is heavier. Owners will need to brush their Huskies once or twice per week (and daily during shedding season) to keep the shedding to a minimum. Occasional hair cleanup may be needed for most of the year, but during the 2 to 3 week shedding seasons, vacuuming the floors and lint rollers use on clothes and furniture will be necessary every few days.</p>

<p>And an Alaskan Husky may drool a bit in anticipation of food or after drinking water--but these dogs are known to pant heavily after exercising, during which time they'll drip saliva from their tongues. It might be best to leave your Alaskan Husky outside for a few minutes after the dog finishes exercising, so it can cool down and stop panting.</p>

<h4>Alaskan Diet</h4>

<img src ="images/dog_feeding.jpg" alt="Dog Begging for Food on Table" class="floatleft">

<p>As an athletic breed type, the Alaskan Husky diet will need to include food that has plenty of animal proteins and carbohydrates for energy; vitamins, minerals, and fiber for digestive and immune health; and omega fatty acids for coat and skin wellness. This means the best choice of food for Alaskan Huskies is the premium dry kind, because it has balanced portions of the above-listed ingredients--nutrients your Husky will need to sustain its health in the long term. Orijen, Royal Canin, and Taste of the Wild are three recommended brands that have excellent lines of premium dry kibble.</p>

<p>Some owners and breeders choose instead to feed their Alaskan Huskies a diet of fresh/prepared foods including lean meats, fruits and vegetables, eggs, and other protein sources--and while this food source is a great choice, many find such a diet for their dogs to be too expensive and time-consuming, and prefer premium dry food. Owners wanting to bolster their Huskies' diets can can add some prepared food (a bit of chicken and a few raw baby carrots, for example) to one meal a day, if they desire. Cheap, generic dog food is not recommended for Alaskan Huskies, because it contains mostly empty "filler" ingredients that simply won't keep a Husky healthy and energetic.</p>

<p>In regards to portions: the typical adult Alaskan Husky, depending on its age, size, and activity level, will need about three and a half cups of dry food per day, divided into two meals. Puppies, again depending on their age, will need a bit less: about two and a half cups per day, divided into three meals (not two) until six months of age.</p>
