<h2>How is Wind Energy used?</h2>


<p>In the past, wind energy was used in sailing and milling production. Today, wind energy is useful in many ways. We use turbines to power homes, farms, and businesses. In 2019 alone, wind energy generated <strong>nearly 300 billion kilowatthours (kWh) and about 7.3% of the total United States utility scale electricity.</strong></p>

<h2>Why is wind energy the most cost effective?</h2>

<p>Green energy is profitable because it's freely available and naturally occurring. Harnessing renewable resources leads to maximum output with minimal cost to our environment. Everyone wins in this scenario, but I know what you're thinking. How much does it actually cost to get energy from coal? From dams? From wind farms?</p>

<p>Estimated cost of power generation method <em>per overnight watt</em> in 2019:</p>

<ul>
<li>Fuel Cells - $7200/kW</li>
<li>Advanced Nuclear - $6000/kW</li>
<li>Coal - $3500-$3800/kW</li>
<li>Hydropower - $2680/kW</li>
<li>Wind - $1600/kW</li>
</ul>

<p>Compared to traditional and other green sources of energy, <strong><em>wind energy is by far the most practical in that list!</em></strong></p>

<h2>Is wind energy safe for the environment?</h2>

<p>In the early days of wind farming, there were complaints about turbine footprints and abuse of eminent domain. There were also concerns over the impact it would have on local wildlife, especially birds. Many landowners were worried about windmills dominating the landscape or taking over lucrative farmland.</p>

<p>Advancements in construction and technology have resolved all of these concerns. Better planning and updated techology lead to smaller blades, slimmer overall design, and a compact footprint. Today, turbines are often built on pastureland without interrupting day to day function. That doubles efficiency! </p>

<p>Early wind farms did have an impact on wildlife population and safety. The close proximity of one turbine to the next made very narrow passageways, interrupting bird migration. The blades themselves caused several bird and bat casualties.</p>

<p>Today we build turbines much further apart allowing for safe passageway. They are also equipped with sensors and will shut down when wildlife is nearby. Future wind farms are sited in less populated areas and away from natural habitats. Ultrasonic speakers are also placed in certain areas to keep bats away from the blades.</p>

<h3>Are you ready to invest in wind energy?</h3>

<p>Not only is wind energy cost effective and a sound investment, but it is a solution to a global crisis. In the words of Bill McKibben, American environmentalist, journalist, author of several books about the environment, including <em>The End of Nature</em>, and leader of the 350.org group:</p>

<br>

<p><center><em>&ldquo; There is an urgent need to stop subsidizing the fossil fuel industry, dramatically reduce wasted energy, and significantly shift our power supplies from oil, coal, and natural gas to wind, solar, geothermal, and other renewable energy sources. &rdquo;</em></center></p>
