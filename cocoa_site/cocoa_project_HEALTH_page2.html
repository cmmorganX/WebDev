<h2>Health Benefits of the Cocoa Bean</h2>

<p class="p">According to the USDA, a tablespoon of cocoa powder only contains 12 calories!</p>

<p>This is great news if you are looking to lose weight but worry you won’t be able to get your chocolate fix.</p>

<p><em>Cocoa beans are a great source of protein</em> as every tablespoon of cocoa powder contains 1 whole gram of protein and minerals like iron, magnesium, and copper.</p>

<p>Several researchers found that eating foods containing cocoa have helped lower blood pressure levels. Cocoa performs this neat little trick by stimulating nitric oxide production. Those antioxidants really can do anything!</p>

<p><em><strong>Speaking of antioxidants,</strong></em> cocoa contains zinc which reduces oxidative stress, a major cause of accelerated aging. Cocoa has higher levels of antioxidant activity than red wine and both green and black tea. Not only can it help you look younger longer, but it help neutralize all those free radicals in your body. Now, that’s a benefit.</p>

<p>There is hope for diabetics as studies have found that eating cocoa can improve insulin resistance and glucose metabolism. Cocoa has also been shown to have anti-depressant effects. The flavonoid present can help boost your mood, combat depression, and promote brain cognition during periods of mental exertion.</p>

<p>In addition, consumption of cocoa can speed up healing, treat constipation, and prevent several mineral deficiencies.</p>
