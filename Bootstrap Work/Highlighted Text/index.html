    <p>The mark element (.mark class) is useful when you want to <mark>highlight</mark> a selection of text.</p>
    <p>It's also useful to highlight a <mark>particular section of text</mark> to distinguish it from the rest of the sentence.</p>
    <p>This is going to be a very large paragraph with a run on sentence that probably won't make a lot of sense but I don't want to use <mark>lorem ipsum</mark> because it's not as easy to highlight a section of text in a large block of text when it's <mark>written in pirate gibberish</mark> or from the perspective of a well-meaning but confused wordsmith in the world of the Lord of the Rings books and talking about the <mark>Great Largination of the Ring Magnus Bombadilius Cooler Second Breakfast Time Ring Bringers Von Under the Mountain.</mark> Plus, there's this sentence as well. Also, there is this sentence with this one last bit of text that is <em>really, <mark>really,</mark> really, different</em> from the rest of the text because of that emphasis tag.</p>
